Hello there! My name is Laknath Ashwin De Silva (ලක්නාත් අශ්වි​න් ද සිල්වා in Sinhalese script). I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. Joshua Vogelstein and co-advised by Dr. Carey E. Priebe (JHU) and Dr. Pratik Chaudhari (UPenn).

I aspire to work towards reducing the gap between machine and natural intelligences. My research primarily focuses on building deep learning and statistical machine learning theory and methods for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization and continually learning systems. Additionally, I have a keen interest in computational neuroscience, computer vision, geometric deep learning, signal processing, and biomedical data science.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering from University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka in 2020 ( ranked *1st among ~950 undergrads* in the Faculty of Engineering). I completed my thesis on *"Designing a Cost-Effective Dry Contact sEMG Sensor System for Controlling a Bionic Hand"* with Dr. [Simon Kappel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HTFY3fsAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Thilina Lalitharatne](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0NvOK1kAAAAJ&hl=en).

I have worked as a Research Assistant at the [Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health](https://florey.edu.au/), University of Melbourne, Australia in 2017 and 2018 under the supervision of Prof. [Steve Petrou](https://www.florey.edu.au/science-research/scientist-directory/professor-steven-petrou) and Prof. [Saman Halgamuge](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=9cafqywAAAAJ&hl=en). There, I developed ML & Signal Processing software for modelling genetic epilepsy using high density multi-electrode array (MEA) signals recorded from in-vitro neuronal networks.

I have worked with Dr. [Steffen Bollmann](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HmXlj24AAAAJ&hl=en) (Center for Advanced Imaging, University of Queensland, Australia) on developing fully convolutional networks to unwrap wrapped phase in QSM images.  

Outside work, I love spending time my wife, playing the piano, hiking, and trying out new recipes. I am an avid fan of astronomy, history, science-fiction, fantasy, and anime!
