My name is Laknath Ashwin De Silva (ලක්නාත් අශ්වි​න් ද සිල්වා in Sinhalese script). I am a PhD student in the Johns Hopkins University, MD, USA advised by Prof. [Joshua Vogelstein](https://neurodata.io/){:target="\_blank"}, Prof. Carey Priebe and Dr. Pratik Chaudhari.

I aspire to work towards reducing the gap between machine and natural intelligences. My areas of interest include {deep, continual, statistical, geometric} learning, signal processing, computer vision, and computational neuroscience.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering from UoM in 2020 while being ranked *1st among ~950 undergrads* in the Faculty of Engineering. I completed my thesis on *"Designing a Cost-Effective Dry Contact sEMG Sensor System for Controlling a Bionic Hand"* with Dr. [Simon Kappel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HTFY3fsAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Thilina Lalitharatne](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0NvOK1kAAAAJ&hl=en).

I worked as a Research Assistant at the [Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health](https://florey.edu.au/), University of Melbourne, Australia in 2017 and 2018 under the supervision of Prof. [Steve Petrou](https://www.florey.edu.au/science-research/scientist-directory/professor-steven-petrou) and Prof. [Saman Halgamuge](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=9cafqywAAAAJ&hl=en). There, I developed ML & Signal Processing software for modelling genetic epilepsy using high density multi-electrode array (MEA) signals recorded from in-vitro neuronal networks.

I also worked with Dr. [Steffen Bollmann](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HmXlj24AAAAJ&hl=en) (Center for Advanced Imaging, University of Queensland, Australia) on developing fully convolutional networks to unwrap wrapped phase in QSM images.  

In my free time, I love spending time my wife, playing the piano, exploring restaurants, and watching numerous movies and TV shows involving science fiction, anime, and historical drama!
