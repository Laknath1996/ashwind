[Hello there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEq1Z0bjdwc)! My name is Ashwin De Silva (අශ්වි​න් ද සිල්වා in Sinhalese script). I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. [Joshua Vogelstein](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DWPfdT4AAAAJ&hl=en), Dr. [Pratik Chaudhari](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=c_z5hWEAAAAJ&hl=en) (UPenn) and Dr. [Carey E. Priebe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=clTVC4UAAAAJ&hl=en).

I broadly work on {machine, deep} learning, with an aspiration of bridging the gap between artificial and natural intelligences. My doctoral research is currently focused on learning under non-stationary distributions and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization with applications in large language models, computer vision, and biomedical data science.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering from University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka in 2020 ( ranked *1st among ~950 undergrads* in the Faculty of Engineering). I completed my thesis on *"Designing a Cost-Effective Dry Contact sEMG Sensor System for Controlling a Bionic Hand"* with Dr. [Simon Kappel](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HTFY3fsAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Thilina Lalitharatne](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0NvOK1kAAAAJ&hl=en). As an undergrad, I interned at [The Florey Institute](https://florey.edu.au/) (University of Melbourne) and Center for Advanced Imaging (University of Queensland), where I worked with Dr. [Steve Petrou](https://www.florey.edu.au/science-research/scientist-directory/professor-steven-petrou), Dr. [Saman Halgamuge](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=9cafqywAAAAJ&hl=en), and Dr. [Steffen Bollmann](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HmXlj24AAAAJ&hl=en).

Outside work, I love spending time with my wife [Malsha](https://malshav.github.io/), playing the piano, hiking, and trying out new recipes. I am also an avid fan of history, astronomy, movies, and sports in general!
