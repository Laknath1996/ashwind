Many folks have reached out to me regarding questions about PhD applications in the recent past, and I intend this article to be a gross summary of my answers to these FAQs. The content of the answers are mostly based on our own experience and that of our friends, colleagues, and mentors. While these answers may generally be useful for any focus area, some may tend to be specific for fields such as computer science, biomedical engineering, and electronics & telcom engineering.

**How should I structure my statement of purpose (SoP)?**

**How should I ask my referees to write letters of recommendation (LoR) for me?**

**What is your opinion about US, European, and Australian PhDs?**

**When should I sit for GRE and TOFEL/IELTS?**

**Should I write to my potential PhD advisors?**
