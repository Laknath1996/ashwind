The project was conducted as a part of the module Digital Signal Processing EN2570. The objective was to design a Non - Recursive (Finite Impulse Response) Bandstop Filter using the Kaiser Window Function.

MATLAB 2014a software package was used as the programming environment for the design project. The results were benchmarked with the MATLAB built in function 'designfilt'. Implementation was successful.
